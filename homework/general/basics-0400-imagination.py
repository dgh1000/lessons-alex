# This is an exercise in imagination. 

# IT'S NOT IMPORTANT YOU DO THIS PERFECTLY. Just give
# it a try. It's not important that you see every number.
# What we are going for is giving you a feel for how
# you can use your imagination to see things that are
# happening in code. 

# Also, feel free to experiment. I'm not asking you to be
# super-creative and come up with some elaborate way of
# imagining code, but it is okay to experiement with a way
# works for you. 

# Before we begin, I want to mention that some people don't
# have a visual imagination. So, I want to ask if you can 
# do something like close your eyes and imagine an apple.
# If you have a hard time with this, we may need to find a 
# different way to do this exercise. However, because you
# are good at drawing and animating, I'm guessing you have a
# pretty good visual imagination.

# Here's a simple loop. First predict what it will do. Then
# uncomment it and run it and see if you were right.

# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)

# 1) How many times does the loop run?
# 2) What is the first value of i?
# 3) What is the last value of i?
# 4) Now write out those values in order from
#    first to last on a sheet of paper.
# 5) Touch each value in turn with your pencil.
# 6) Now close your eyes and see if you can imagine
#    touching each value in turn. You don't need to
#    make it special or be particularly creative.
#    Just see if you can imagine it.
# 7) Now, you might have noticed that the loop 
#    printed the numbers 0 through 9, one number on
#    each line. So write down the numbers 0 through
#    9 on a sheet of paper, one number on each line.
# 8) Touch each line in turn with your pencil.
# 9) Now close your eyes and see if you can imagine
#    touching each line.

# Now let's do something a little more complicated.
# Close your eyes and try to imagine looking at each
# number in the row at the top as you look at the corresponding
# line where it gets printed at the same time. Move
# along the top row from left to right and down the 
# printed rows from top to bottom at the same time.
