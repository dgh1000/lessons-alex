# Q1: do Q1 again just to review basic concepts of input and strings

# x = input()
# y = input()
# z = input()

# print(z, y, x)

# Q2: do Q2 again just to review basic concepts of input and math

# step = int(input()) 
# print(step *30)

# Q3: do Q3 again 

# number = int(input())
# equation = input()

# if equation == "A":
#     print(number + 1)
# if equation == "B":
#     print(number *2)
# if equation == "C":
#     print(number *number)

# to review first
#
# Q3 A:
#   write a program that inputs a string and prints it. Now write a program
#   that inputs two ints and multiplies them and prints the result

string = input()
print(string)

integer = int(input())
integer2 = int(input())
print(integer * integer2)
