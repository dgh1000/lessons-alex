# Perse Coding Team Challenge: section "2020-21 R1 Review Mode"

# Question 1:
#
# (this is based on question 2021 R1 Q2: Factory Hopperville)
#
# Let me show you some code to compare strings alphabetically:
#
s1 = "Mike"
s2 = "lex"
if s1 < s2:
    print(s1 + " is first alphabetically")
else:
    print(s2 + " is first alphabetically")

# Q 1A. Uncomment this code, predict what it will do, then run it.
#       (also type it yourself to get it under your fingers)                A: Alex is first alphabetically
# Q 1B. Modify s1 and s2 so the that the other branch of the if runs.
# Q 1C. Now modify this program so it inputs two strings rather than
#       using the hard-coded string literals you see here.
