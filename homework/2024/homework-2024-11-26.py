# Q5 A. I don't know how good you are with writing (English), Alex,
#  but good practice for Q5 might be to write the directions in your
#  own words. In particular, see if you can shorten the lengthy 
#  problem description while still keeping the essence of it.

# Q5 B. Then shorten your description even more until each sentence 
# corresponds to one line of code. (Put each English sentence on its
# own line.) For example, you could write the following in English
# to describe one line of code:

# Let me give some examples:

# English: "Input the user's name."
# Python: name = input("Enter your name: ")

# English: "If they entered yes, do the following."
# Python: if response == "yes":
#             <the following goes here>
