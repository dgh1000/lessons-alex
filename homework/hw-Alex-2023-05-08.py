# We didn't go over many details during the lesson so this is just some stuff to play
# with before the next lesson.

# Here's some code:
# x = 3
# y = x + 2
# z = x + y
# print(z, y, x)


# Predict what this code will do, then run it by uncommenting and running this module
# and check your prediction.
# (Remember, to uncomment, you highlight the above lines and then press Ctrl-/)
# (Remember, to run the module you click the play button in the upper-right)

# Some more code:
# for i in range(3):
#     print(i)

# Again predict what this will do, then run it and check your prediction.

# Some more code:
# for i in range(5):
#     print(i+1)

# Again predict what this will do, then run it and check.

# Finally, modify the code on lines 16-17 so when you run it it prints the following:
# (not counting the #'s)
# 0
# 1
# 2
