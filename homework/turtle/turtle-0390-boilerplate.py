# Explanation of boilerplate code: 
# 
# this file just explains what code is necessary in a turtle
# file. "Boilerplate" is the code that has to be in every turtle
# file.  It's the stuff that initializes the turtle, and then
# waits for the user to click on the screen to exit.  

# This example file just draws a line.  It's the simplest
# turtle file possible.  It's a good starting point for
# writing a new turtle file.

# This line must go at the top.
from turtle import *

# Replace this with your own code.
pendown()
forward(100)

# This line must go at the bottom.
mainloop()
