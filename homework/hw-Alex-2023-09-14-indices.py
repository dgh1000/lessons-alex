# Uncomment the following code. You'll use it in every problem
# below.

# s1 = "hello"

# question #1. 

# Now write code that prints every other letter in s1. Use
# the 3-parameter form of range() to do this.

# question #2.

# Write code that prints the first and last letters in s1. You
# won't use range() for this. You'll just subscript s1 (using
# square brackets) to get the first and last letters.

# question #3.

# Uncomment the following line
# s2 = "hellothere"

# Now Write code that prints every third letter of the string.
# Use range() to do this.
